This is read me file

Notes:
 - webpack.config file has entry file (index.html), output file (dist/app.js) and ts-loader (which makes the webpack know the files are in ts and need to use ts-loader)
 - webpack actually has dist as the default output folder.
 - The index.html has the root element where the first component gets loaded and after loading that, the output script generated by webpack above is placed.
 - ts-config file sets the jsx render engine, script standards like ES6 or ES2015 etc.
 - It now cannot have the out file as it is mentioned in webpack.config already.

        - docker inspect <containerid> | grep IPAddress => get ip address and use http://<ipaddress>:port
